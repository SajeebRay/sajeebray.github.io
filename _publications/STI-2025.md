Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an essential technology for enhancing human-computer interactions (HCI). While most SER research uses air-conducted (AC) speech, bone-conducted (BC) speech offers a resilient alternative, especially in noisy environments. This paper introduces an end-to-end SER system based on the Wav2Vec2.0 transformer model, fine-tuned with the EmoBone dataset—a comprehensive, multinational BC speech dataset featuring eight emotion categories collected from 29 speakers in 10 countries. Our method utilizes self-supervised learning to bypass manual feature extraction, learning detailed contextual features directly from raw audio waveforms. The system combines a custom classification head with the pre-trained Wav2Vec2.0 encoder for efficient emotion prediction. Evaluation results show that our approach attains an overall accuracy of 93% and a weighted average F1-score of 93% on the EmoBone dataset, markedly surpassing earlier best-performing techniques. The model demonstrates strong effectiveness in separating emotions with unique acoustic features but encounters challenges differentiating acoustically similar emotions like neutral-sad and fear-disgust pairs. These results underscore the promising capabilities of transformer-based architectures for BC speech emotion recognition and set a new standard for future studies. Additional ablation studies evaluate channel effects (AC-only, BC-only, and AC+BC fusion) and pretraining configurations (from-scratch, linear probe, full fine-tune). This study is among the first to demonstrate self-supervised transformer efficacy for bone-conducted emotion recognition, setting a benchmark for future SER research.
