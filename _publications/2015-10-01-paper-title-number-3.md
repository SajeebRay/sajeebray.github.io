In this research, developed a deep multi-task learning CNN model (MTL-CNN) for fruit freshness detection and fruit-type classification, achieving 98.63% accuracy by leveraging shared feature extraction and addressing imbalanced datasets. The model outperforms existing methods like InceptionV3 and CNN_BiLSTM, offering significant implications for automated quality control, food safety, and waste reduction in the agricultural and consumer sectors.
