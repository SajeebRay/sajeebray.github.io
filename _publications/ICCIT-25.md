Price volatility remains a persistent challenge in the retail sector of Bangladesh, with frequent market price fluctuations creating operational inefficiencies in the market. This paper presents an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) solution that addresses these challenges through a Smart Product Price Display Board system. The proposed system revolutionizes conventional static displays by implementing a dynamic, automated solution that eliminates inefficiencies and errors in manual price updating. The architecture comprises a microcontroller-based digital display integrated with an IoT communication platform, enabling real-time remote price management through a centralized server infrastructure. Key features include a user-friendly web interface allowing authorized personnel to execute instantaneous price updates across multiple display units, ensuring network-wide consistency and accuracy. The solution enhances operational efficiency while improving customer experience through accurate, up-to-date pricing information. Development encompassed comprehensive hardware assembly, custom software development, and rigorous testing protocols to validate system reliability. Performance evaluation demonstrated superior metrics compared to traditional methods, with the prototype achieving 99.44% accuracy during testing. The system exhibited exceptional hardware stability with zero component failures or thermal issues. This positions the solution as a viable long-term investment for retail modernization. This IoT-based solution represents a significant technological advancement in retail price management, demonstrating measurable improvements in operational efficiency, pricing accuracy, and customer satisfaction. The project underscores the transformative potential of IoT in addressing real-world commercial challenges and modernizing traditional retail practices in the evolving market environment of Bangladesh.
