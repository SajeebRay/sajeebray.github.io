The Embedded Systems-based AC Device Controller automates the operation of AC devices using a microcontroller and real-time clock (RTC) for precise, user-defined durations. It enhances energy efficiency, operational safety, and convenience by eliminating manual intervention and preventing unnecessary power usage. 

Abstract: The Embedded Systems-based AC Device Controller represents a multifaceted and intelligent apparatus devised to regulate the functioning of single-phase AC devices, including motors, lighting fixtures, and various electrical appliances, for a user-defined duration. This system is constructed around a microcontroller that automates the switching mechanism, thereby obviating the necessity for manual intervention. Users possess the capability to program the controller to activate a device for a predetermined duration such as one hour subsequently leading to its automatic deactivation. The fundamental operation is facilitated through the integration of a real-time clock (RTC), which furnishes precise timekeeping to ensure meticulous control over the operational duration. The system is designed for ease of configuration, enabling the user to establish diverse time intervals tailored to specific applications. It guarantees efficient energy consumption by precluding devices from remaining powered unnecessarily, thereby mitigating power wastage and enhancing operational safety. This attribute is particularly advantageous in contexts where timely regulation of appliances is imperative, such as in industrial automation, domestic appliances, and agricultural machinery. Moreover, the controller can be modified to accommodate various load types and power ratings, rendering it a versatile solution for a wide array of use cases. By providing dependable and automated control, this AC device controller augments convenience, enhances energy efficiency and offers a safer, more trustworthy alternative to conventional manual switching systems.
