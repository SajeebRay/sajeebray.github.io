<H3>After joining Solver Green club, I was honored to serve as the Convener for a research course</H3>

I’m happy to share the great success of our **Unlocking Research: From Concept to Publication** course — the first research-based course at Pabna University of Science and Technology (PUST). As the convener, I’m proud to announce that the first batch filled up in just 3 days, and the second batch was full in only 1 day! 

This course aims to empower students with the essential tools to contribute meaningfully to research, both at PUST and for Bangladesh as a whole. With 250 participants engaged, I am confident we will nurture a new wave of research talent.

None of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the Solver Green team.
