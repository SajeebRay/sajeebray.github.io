As part of this incredible community, I’m eager to contribute to the Research section by organizing seminars, workshops, and launching new courses. My goal is to encourage not only final-year students but also junior students to get involved in research from an early stage.

Why wait until the final year to explore research? Let’s build a culture where students can grow through inquiry, collaboration, and innovation from the start!

<H3>After joining this club, I was honored to serve as the Convener for a research course</H3>

I’m happy to share the great success of our **Unlocking Research: From Concept to Publication** course — the first research-based course at Pabna University of Science and Technology (PUST). As the convener, I’m proud to announce that the first batch filled up in just 3 days, and the second batch was full in only 1 day! 

This course aims to empower students with the essential tools to contribute meaningfully to research, both at PUST and for Bangladesh as a whole. With 250 participants engaged, I am confident we will nurture a new wave of research talent.

None of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the Solver Green team.
