As part of this incredible community, I’m eager to contribute to the Research section by organizing seminars, workshops, and launching new courses. My goal is to encourage not only final-year students but also junior students to get involved in research from an early stage.

Why wait until the final year to explore research? Let’s build a culture where students can grow through inquiry, collaboration, and innovation from the start!
