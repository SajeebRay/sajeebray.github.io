Innovation Showcasing-2024 was an idea design competition where I proposed "Smart Bedroom Technology" to assist physically challenged individuals, especially those from middle-income families.

The event was organized by the ICT Cell of PUST. I was a joint champion alongside another project, "Vehicle Tracking with Alarm," designed to help students track varsity buses passing near their homes.

The awards were presented to me by the Honorable Vice-Chancellor, the Director of the ICT Cell, and the Student Advisor's Office. <img src='/files/Innovation.jpg'>
