Imagine a situation with no electricity, internet, or cellular network—exactly the dire circumstances faced by people in the Bangladeshi coastal region during a cyclone. In such critical moments, access to vital cyclone updates from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) becomes a matter of life and death. Without this information, lives are at grave risk.
To address this challenge, PREVENTERs proposed an innovative solution at Disaster Hackathon 2.0. Our technology aims to deliver real-time forecasts from BMD to these vulnerable regions within minutes, even under adverse conditions.
This groundbreaking idea earned us a spot among the top 5 finalists in the hackathon. Although we could not secure a place in the top 3, the three days of intensive mentoring sessions helped refine our solution, making it feasible and compact enough to deliver as a viable product. Over the course of the event, we redesigned and presented our concept more than 30 times, ensuring its alignment with real-world needs.
We were also offered an opportunity to pilot our solution, with the potential to make a significant impact during disaster situations. Collaborating with the other four finalist teams was a highlight of the event—their invaluable suggestions and shared commitment to addressing disaster challenges made the experience truly rewarding.

Special thanks to my amazing teammates—Naima Islam, MH Rokon, Muhammad Sagor vai and AL AMIN. Their hard work and dedication made us proud throughout this journey!
