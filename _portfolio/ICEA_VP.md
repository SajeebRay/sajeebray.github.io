Since taking responsibility, the first executive committee of the ICE Association has been working with the aim of building a new positive culture in the department. During its tenure, the committee has taken a number of significant initiatives, among which the notable ones are—

1. Officially launching the activities of three clubs in the department, with respected faculty members serving as advisors to help ensure the smooth operations of each club.

2. Taking necessary steps to ensure that the merit scholarships awarded by the university are delivered to students on time.

3. Maintaining regular and close communication with respected faculty members to strengthen research-based academic activities.

4. Proposing a new logo for the department, which has been approved by the academic committee.

5. Initiating the process of allocating a separate room for the ICE Association, which will allow 24-hour access for club and other group activities.

6. Celebrating Pahela Baishakh (Bengali New Year) in a new way.

7. Organizing Iftar Mahfil in a different manner.

8. Arranging various sports and games from time to time to help maintain students’ physical and mental well-being.

9. Achieving the commitment to launch a long-awaited seminar and library, which will soon be implemented.

10. Taking the initiative to find collective solutions whenever students face problems.

In successfully implementing each of these initiatives, we have received sincere guidance and support from our honorable President, the Departmental Chairman, and respected faculty members. Every member of the committee has strived to fulfill their responsibilities with dedication and sincerity

We have carried out all our activities as general students of the department, without misusing any position of authority, and always trying to work on the basis of equality and mutual respect. We strongly believe that only through unity and cooperation can we move the department forward.
