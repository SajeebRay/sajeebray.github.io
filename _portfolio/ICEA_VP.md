The ICE Association is an organization in which all students of the Department of ICE are default members. It supports students by providing mental, financial, and extracurricular assistance. I am honored to officially take on the role of Vice President of the ICE Association, the highest student-held position within its constitution. My journey with this association began unofficially, during which I organized several key events like the '1st Alumni Reunion and Fiesta - 2025,' along with tours, picnics, and sports activities.
