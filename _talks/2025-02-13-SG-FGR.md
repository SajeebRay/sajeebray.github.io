### Introduction
Welcome, everyone! Research is an exciting journey where we seek knowledge, solve problems, and make meaningful contributions to our fields. But for many students, starting research can feel overwhelming. My goal today is to break it down into simple steps, helping you understand the process and gain confidence.

## What is Research?

Research is more than just collecting information; it’s about discovering new knowledge. We have two main types of research:

  - Theoretical Research – Focuses on developing new ideas and concepts.
  - Applied Research – Solves real-world problems using existing knowledge.

Many groundbreaking inventions started with simple research ideas. Whether you want to create new theories or build practical solutions, research helps you grow intellectually and professionally.

## Why Do Research?
Engaging in research has several benefits:

  -  Personal Growth – Research enhances critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
  -  Career Benefits – A strong research background makes your resume stand out and opens opportunities for scholarships.
  -  Writing Skills – Research improves academic and professional writing, which is essential in any career.

In short, research is a valuable skill that can open many doors in your academic and professional life.

## Steps to Start Research
Starting research may seem complex, but following these steps makes it easier:

  -  Read Recent Research Papers – Stay updated with new developments.
  -  Choose a Research Topic – Find a subject that interests you.
  -  Collect Data – Conduct experiments or use publicly available datasets.
  -  Analyze Data – Identify patterns and draw conclusions.
  -  Store Your Findings – Keep your results well-organized.
  -  Write Your Research Paper – Share your findings with the world.

## Challenges Students Face in Research
Many students struggle to start research because of these reasons:

  -  Research Papers Are Hard to Understand – Scientific papers contain complex language and technical terms.
  -  Choosing a Topic Is Difficult – Many students feel lost when selecting a research area.
These challenges often discourage students from pursuing research. But don’t worry—there’s an easier way to start!

## A Beginner’s Approach to Research
Instead of starting from scratch, follow this approach:

  -  Learn from Existing Research
      -  Use AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity to simplify research papers.
      -  Ask seniors or professors for guidance.
  -  Modify and Improve an Existing Study
      -  Change a method, use new datasets, or refine findings.
  -  Write Your Own Research Based on These Improvements
      -  Build confidence by improving existing work.

By following this method, you can ease into research and gradually develop your own ideas.

## Elements of a Research Paper
A complete research paper typically includes the following sections:

  -  Abstract – A brief summary of the research.
  -  Introduction – Defines the problem, provides background, and explains the research goal.
  -  Literature Review – Reviews previous studies related to the topic.
  -  Methodology – Describes how the research was conducted.
  -  Results & Discussion – Presents findings, compares them with past research, and discusses their significance.
  -  Conclusion – Summarizes key takeaways and suggests future research directions.
  -  References – Lists all sources cited in the paper.

In this session, we focused on writing three key sections: Introduction, Methodology, and Results & Discussion. These are essential parts of any research paper, as they define the study, explain how it was conducted, and interpret the findings.

## Writing a Research Paper
1. Introduction (With Literature Review)
The introduction is crucial as it sets the stage for your research. A well-written introduction keeps readers engaged and shows your research attitude. It should:

  -  Explain what problem you are solving.
  -  Summarize what others have done in this field.
  -  Highlight what is missing and how your research is different. 

    The introduction should contextualize your study and give any specialized information the general measurement or control reader may require to understand what follows. It must describe the importance of relevant earlier work and the challenges your work solves. It should also list your work's comparators. The introduction should define the article's contribution(s) and show how it's shown in the rest of the manuscript. A typical introduction should be as brief as possible and would contain the following:  

    a). An outline of the problem.  
    b). A review of the relevant literature, noting briefly the major contributors and indicating:  
        - What the main contributors did?  
        - What the main contributors found?  
    c). A statement of unsolved problems and/or areas requiring improvement, particularly the one(s) considered in your manuscript.  
    d). In regard to the above, describe what you will perform that has not been done before (what are your new contributions?).  
    e). An outline of how the following sections show what you did and how its relevance will be demonstrated.  

    Note: This first section of the main text should describe the problem, any existing solutions you are aware of, and the major limitations. Also, explain what you hope to achieve through your research.


2. Methodology (How You Conducted the Research)
This section explains the research process in detail. It should include:

  -  Step-by-step explanation of the research process.
  -  Justification for choosing the methods.
  -  Enough detail so others can repeat the experiment.

  >  The method section is a detailed step-by-step description of the experimental procedure that includes all of the information needed to replicate the work described in the paper. The Method must include a description of both novel and standard experimental approaches, as well as whatever minimal justification is required to persuade the reader that the methods are correct.
   > A well-written Method section:  
   > a). Is the "how-to" section of your paper, containing all of the pertinent details for producing your results.  
   > b). Persuades the reader that your approach is correct by providing justification for selecting your methodology, which may include analysis or theoretical justification.  
  > c). Gives readers the details, algorithms, and techniques necessary to confirm and/or replicate your findings.  
  > The Methods section's purpose is to describe how the questions and knowledge gaps raised in the Introduction will be addressed in the Results section.  


3. Results & Discussion (What You Found & What It Means)
This section presents your findings and their significance:

  -  Summarize the key results.
  -  Compare them with previous research.
  -  Mention any limitations or weaknesses in your study.
  -  Suggest future improvements.

    A great discussion should be well-organized.  
    One of the keys to writing a great paper is having a thorough and concise discussion. It provides a critical platform for interpreting and connecting your findings to the larger scientific context. The structure presented below is a traditional 6-step approach to creating a well-crafted discussion section, which you should carefully consider.  

    a). `Introduction—mention gaps in previous research`
    Example: This study looked into the effects of "....." While previous studies investigated the impact of ".....", they did not explicitly address its influence on ".....".  

    b). `Summarizing key findings—let your data speak`
    Example: We found that "....." correlates with ".....". The proposed method in this study tended to have an inordinately higher proportion of "....." as ".....".  

    c). `Interpreting results—compare with other papers`
    Example: Our findings indicate that higher "....." is not associated with poor performance in ".....". The proposed method may benefit from "....." without negatively affecting ".....".  

    d). `Addressing limitations—their potential impact on the results`
    Example: This study investigated a comprehensive "....." and ".....". However, additional and in-depth research may be required to confirm its ".....", particularly regarding ".....".  

    e). `Implications for future research—how to explore further`
    Example: Our research shows that "...." is more resilient than ".....". Future research may look into "....." and practical methods for producing ".....".  

    f). `Conclusion—summarize content` 
    Example: Recent observations indicate that the ".....". Our findings offer definitive proof that this phenomenon is linked to "....." alteration, rather than being caused by increased quantities of ".....". `

A strong discussion connects your research to the broader scientific community.

## Useful Tools for Research
Using the right tools makes research easier:

  -  To understand papers: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Typeset.io, Scholarly.
  -  Research databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, Springer, Kaggle.
  -  Reference managers: Zotero, Mendeley (for organizing citations).
  -  Data analysis tools: Python (NumPy, Pandas), MATLAB, Excel.
  -  Writing tools: Grammarly, Overleaf (for LaTeX).

These tools help simplify research, improve efficiency, and enhance the quality of your work.

## Journal Ranking and Indexing
When choosing a journal for publication, rankings matter:

  -  Q1 (Best) → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 (Based on quality and impact).
  -  To check journal rankings, visit:
      -  SJR (Scimago Journal & Country Rank): scimagojr.com
      -  Scopus Sources: scopus.com/sources

Publishing in high-ranked journals increases the visibility and credibility of your research.

## Final Tips for Beginner Researchers

- Start small – Your first research doesn’t have to be groundbreaking.
- Learn from others – Read research papers and discuss them.
- Be patient – Research takes time and effort.
- Improve existing work – Modify and build on previous studies.
- Ask for help – Use AI tools, teachers, and mentors for guidance.

Remember, research is a journey, and every expert was once a beginner.
