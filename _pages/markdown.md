<H3> Competitive Programming </H3>
I was started competitive programming in May 2020 and solved over 750 problems on various online judges. Unfortunately, I had to leave competitive programming in March 2023 because most of the NCPC and ICPC contests were scheduled during my exams. This was a particularly disappointing time for me, as I wanted to participate but couldn't perform due to my academic commitments. Here are my achievements: <br>
  <ul> 
  <li> 1st Runner Up, ICE Fiesta Programming Contest 2024 </li>
  <li> Champion, ICE Fiesta Programming Contest 2023 </li>
  <li> Bangladesh 3rd Rank (Global 350th), Codeforces Round 857 (Div. 2) </li>
  <li> Bangladesh 5th Rank (Global 123rd), CodeChef Starters 79 (Div. 2) </li>
  <li> Bangladesh 4th Rank (Global 171st), CodeChef Starters 49 (Div. 4) </li>
  </ul>
